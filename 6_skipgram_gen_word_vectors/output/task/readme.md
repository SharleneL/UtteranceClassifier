**All data under this folder are generated by task-error & task-correct data**

- `ch2v_corpus_output`: a list of space-separated characters, which is a concatination of task-error & task-correct data sets; this is the input file for generating character2vector vector **model**.
- `ch2v_word_list`: dictionary from task-error & task-correct data sets
- `ch2v_spaced_word_list`: the same file as `ch2v_word_list`, except all the words are space seperated. This is the input file for `tools.py`, which is used to generate the word's vectors.
- ch2v_vector_list: the vectors generated by `tools.py`, each line corresponding to one line in `ch2v_spaced_word_list`.


- `ch2v_cep_spaced_word_list`: same with `ch2v_spaced_word_list`, except that this dictionary only contains the words in <Correct, Error> Pairs(AKA, if a word only exists in its correct form, it will not appear in this list).
- `ch2v_cep_word_list`: same with `ch2v_word_list`, except that this dictionary only contains the words in <correct, error> pairs.
- `ch2v_cep_vector_list`: same with `ch2v_vector_list`, except that this dictionary only contains the words in <correct, error> pairs.
