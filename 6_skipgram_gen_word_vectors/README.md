## Introduction
This folder contains all code to convert each word in utterances into a vector using the trained model.

## Folder & Files
- `data/`: contains all the data files
- `code/`: contains all the code
	- `ch2vec_preprocess.py`: generates the input file to generate character2vector .bin file
	- `gen_ch2vec_input_data`: generates the input file for word vectors
	- `encode.py`: run on server; load trained model and input file generated by `gen_ch2vec_input_data`, generates word vector for each line of input
- `output/`: folder to save the files generated by `ch2vec_preprocess.py` and `gen_ch2vec_input_data.py`, currently saves two folders with output files generated by former experiments
