# Introduction
This set of experiment is to run Deep Learning/Logistic Regression on Correct/Error dataset, and make comparisons

# About folders & files:
1. `Code`: contains the code & lib
    - `keras_detect.py`: the main file to run deep learning
    - `sklearn_lr_detect.py`: the main file to run logistic regression
    - `data_process.py`: contains all functions to process the raw utterance data & save into .pickle files to be used by keras
    - `DataForm.py`: the class to load .pickle file for keras
    - `lstm.py`: lib file from keras
    - `imdb.py`: lib file from keras
2. `Data`: contains the category and original/correct/error utterances
    - `chat/` and `utterances/` folders contain the raw utterances file
    - `output/` folder saves the n-fold .pickle files generated by `keras_detect.py`

# Running Instructions
## To run deep learning algorithm
1. `cd` to the `Code` folder & run `python keras_detect.py`, the python file will generate 5-fold training and testing data under `train_test_datasets` folder
2. `cd` to `Code` folder and check the input path in `DataForm.py`; run `python lstm.py` 

## To run sk-learn logistic regression algorithm
1. `cd` to the `Code` folder & open `sklearn_lr_detect.py` file
2. Change the input file path in line 30~34, if needed; change the parameter of `get_utterances` function in line 42, 48, 53, if needed
3. Run `python sklearn_lr_detect.py`
